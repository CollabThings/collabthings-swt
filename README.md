Collabthings
============

Currently Collabthings works only in Windows. Here is an installer and a zip file you can just unpack somewhere https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz7VbxBxfzsJTEs3cmNUeGZxZ2c?usp=sharing .

Instructions
==
- Install and start IPFS daemon. https://ipfs.io/docs/install/
- start Collabthings client

Current status
====
- identities has not been implemented yet. Username is always 'unknown_user'
- search works only with exact object ids.
- bookmarks arent stored anywhere

So if you want to look at somebody elses objects or something you have created previously, you'll have to store the id somewhere. This makes the software pretty much useless :) but it is work in progress.
